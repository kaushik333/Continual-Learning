# An overview of Incremental few shot learning methods.

The area of few shot learning addresses the problem of how to use only few samples from a particular class and learn to classify it as opposed to using 100s or 1000s of samples. This problem in itself is not practically very useful, because one would not want a classifier to learn new classes by erasing previous knowledge, but rather add to it. This has given rise to the area of Incremental Continual Learning. We will now review some papers in this area, understand the philosphy of their idea and walk through the technical details of the contributions. 

We will consider the following 5 papers:

1. [Dynamic Few-Shot Visual Learning without Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09458)
2. [Incremental Few-Shot Learning with Attention Attractor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07218)
3. [XtarNet: Learning to Extract Task-Adaptive Representation for Incremental Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08561)
4. [Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10956)
5. [Incremental few-shot learning via vector quantization in deep embedded space ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3SV-ZePhnZM)
